# ASCILINE Remix Renderer Roadmap

## Purpose

ASCILINE Remix is a fork of ASCILINE focused on renderer experimentation. The goal is to combine:

- The high-performance streamed frame pipeline from this repository: FastAPI, OpenCV frame preparation, adaptive WebSocket codec, audio-master sync, buffering, frame dropping, and Canvas fallback rendering.
- The browser GPU visual output from `ascii-point-and-click`: WebGPU primary rendering, WebGL2 fallback rendering, browser-only media sources, and the point-and-click renderer defaults.

The project is not adopting the `ascii-point-and-click` game UI. This fork should become a renderer lab where video/image sources can be rendered through multiple backends and tuned live with exhaustive controls.

## Confirmed Product Decisions

- The target "quality" is the current WebGPU/WebGL visual output from `ascii-point-and-click`, not its unused glyph atlas/LUT path.
- The app must support both backend-streamed mode and static browser-only mode.
- WebGPU-capable Chromium browsers are the primary target.
- WebGL2 and Canvas are required fallbacks.
- Live reconfiguration over the active WebSocket is preferred.
- Every internal knob should be exposed in the UI.
- Presets are first-class and should switch gracefully over a user-configurable transition duration.
- The rendered output should be able to pop out into its own fullscreen-capable window for use on another display.
- The renderer should start automatically on load with a usable static source when no stream is available.
- The `ascii-point-and-click` renderer and assets should be copied into this repository as source files.
- Browser and Tauri builds should stay local-only at runtime: no CDN decoders, online canvas dependencies, or remote media-provider dependencies in the static path.
- Audio-reactive rendering should be local-only: browser builds use Web Audio against local files, microphone/input streams, or user-selected display audio; Tauri builds should hide platform audio capture behind a desktop adapter.

## Architecture

### Runtime Modes

1. **Stream Mode**
   - Source: FastAPI `/ws` frame stream plus optional `/audio`.
   - Current strengths retained: adaptive codec, audio clock sync, frame buffering, server-side downscale, server-side quantization, and low bandwidth.
   - Client receives decoded frames and hands them to the active renderer backend.

2. **Static Mode**
   - Source: browser-native media (`video`, `image`, local camera, or local multi-camera mix).
   - No Python server required.
   - Uses the copied `ascii-point-and-click` media source and GPU sampling architecture.
   - Can be served by any static HTTP server.
   - Multi-camera input is composited locally through Canvas2D and exposed to the renderers as a single local `MediaStream`.

### Renderer Interface

All renderers should conform to the same interface:

```js
renderer.init({
  targetElement,
  cols,
  rows,
  source,
  params
})

renderer.renderFrame(frame)
renderer.updateParams(params)
renderer.resize()
renderer.destroy()
renderer.getStats()
```

Backends:

- `webgpu`: primary browser GPU path.
- `webgl2`: fallback browser GPU path.
- `canvas2d`: current ASCILINE glyph/text canvas fallback.
- `pixel-canvas`: current ASCILINE pixel frame fallback.

The initial implementation can use a pragmatic adapter layer around the copied point-and-click WebGPU/WebGL2 renderers and the existing Canvas2D path. Later work can consolidate shader code and frame formats.

## Renderer Parameter Model

The app should maintain one canonical parameter object. Controls, presets, URL params, and server control messages all read/write this object.

### Defaults

Use the `ascii-point-and-click` renderer defaults:

```json
{
  "sourceMode": "stream",
  "backend": "auto",
  "cols": 480,
  "fps": 24,
  "saturationBoost": 1.4,
  "contrastBoost": 1.2,

## Local Environment

Use Podman for a reproducible development shell and Linux virtualenv on macOS. The setup should follow the proven pattern from the sibling `pool` repo:

- Prefer Podman install paths used by Podman Desktop and Homebrew on macOS.
- Detect and export the active `podman-machine-default` socket through `CONTAINER_HOST`.
- Start the macOS Podman machine when it exists but is stopped.
- Retry once when the machine socket is stale.
- Require rootless Podman.
- Smoke-test container execution with a small Alpine container.
- Build one local dev image with Python, FFmpeg, OpenCV dependencies, and Node 24 LTS for JavaScript codec checks.
- Allow `NODE_MAJOR=26 scripts/podman_build.sh` for current-release smoke testing while keeping LTS as the default.
- Create `.venv-linux/` from inside the container so dependency resolution does not depend on the host macOS Python/OpenSSL state.
- Support supervised long-running renderer/static-server commands with `ASCILINE_RESTART=1 scripts/podman_run.sh ...`, restarting unexpected child-command exits until the wrapper is stopped.

Primary commands:

```bash
scripts/podman-doctor.sh
scripts/podman_build.sh
scripts/podman_venv.sh
scripts/podman_run.sh bash
scripts/podman_codec_tests.sh
```

## Live Reconfiguration

### Client-Only Parameters

These can update instantly with `renderer.updateParams()`:

- saturation
- contrast
- brightness
- gamma
- background blend
- jitter amount
- jitter speed
- smoothing
- target FPS
- stats overlay
- transition duration

### Renderer Rebuild Parameters

These may require texture/canvas reallocation:

- backend
- cols
- rows
- cell width
- cell height
- pixel mode
- glyph/solid mode when implemented by different shader programs

The UI should keep the app alive while rebuilding. If a rebuild is needed, initialize the new renderer offscreen or behind the current renderer, crossfade, then clean up the old renderer.

### Stream Control Parameters

These should be sent over the active WebSocket as control messages:

```json
{
  "type": "params",
  "params": {
    "cols": 480,
    "rows": 135,
    "mode": 5,
    "pixel": false,
    "codecQuality": "balanced"
  }
}
```

The server should distinguish between:

- **soft changes**, which can apply immediately to timing/codec parameters.
- **reinit changes**, which require a new `INIT` message and decoder/frame-buffer rebuild while preserving the WebSocket connection.

## Audio-Reactive Rendering

Audio reactivity is an ephemeral modulation layer over the canonical renderer parameters. The saved `params` object remains the source of truth for controls, presets, persistence, source selection, and renderer rebuild decisions. Audio analysis produces `effectiveParams` each animation frame, and renderers consume those effective params for live visual output.

### Browser Sources

- **Audio file:** selected through a local file picker and played through Web Audio. The file remains local and is never uploaded.
- **Mic / input:** captured with `getUserMedia({ audio: true })`; echo cancellation, noise suppression, and automatic gain are disabled by default so analysis receives a cleaner signal.
- **Display audio:** captured with `getDisplayMedia()` when the browser and OS expose a display, window, or tab audio track. This is permission-gated and browser-dependent; Chromium on macOS is most reliable when sharing a browser tab with audio enabled, while app/window capture often omits audio.

### Analysis Model

- Use one `AudioContext` with an `AnalyserNode` and local source node.
- Extract RMS, bass, mid, treble, spectral flux, beat pulse, and a phase clock.
- Keep analysis low-latency: use an interactive audio context, a short transient analyser for RMS/beat/flux, a higher-resolution spectral analyser for bass/mid/treble, and fast-attack/controlled-release smoothing so rising beats affect renderer params quickly without making releases visually chaotic.
- Keep beat detection simple and deterministic initially: short rolling RMS history, flux confirmation, and cooldown.

### Modulation Semantics

- Audio frames must not mutate or persist `params`.
- Audio frames should only modulate live-safe visual controls by default: brightness, contrast, saturation, gamma, background blend, jitter amount/speed, and sample offsets.
- Structural controls such as backend, source, media URL, grid allocation, camera devices, and shader-program switches remain manual/preset-driven because changing them per beat would cause rebuild churn.
- Manual sliders and preset transitions continue to move the base `params`; audio modulation is recomputed on top of the current base state.
- Stream mode keeps WebSocket control messages tied to base params. Audio changes affect client-side rendering without spamming structural stream controls.

### Tauri Direction

- Keep browser Web Audio providers behind a small audio-source adapter.
- Add Tauri providers later for local audio files selected via dialog and platform-specific loopback/system audio capture.
- Prefer bundling any required native sidecar or Rust audio capture implementation with the app; do not add online audio dependencies.
- Treat system audio capture as platform-specific:
  - macOS may require ScreenCaptureKit or user-approved audio capture paths.
  - Windows can use WASAPI loopback.
  - Linux may depend on PipeWire/PulseAudio availability.
- Keep modulation output as renderer params so the visual renderer does not care whether the features came from Web Audio or a Tauri-native provider.

## Presets

Presets store complete effective renderer state, not just a partial diff. This makes preset switching predictable and exportable.

```json
{
  "id": "arcade-rain",
  "name": "Arcade Rain",
  "transitionSeconds": 1.5,
  "params": {
    "backend": "auto",
    "cols": 480,
    "cellWidth": 2,
    "cellHeight": 3,
    "saturationBoost": 1.65,
    "contrastBoost": 1.35,
    "bgBlend": 0.25,
    "jitterAmount": 0.45,
    "jitterSpeed": 1.1,
    "solidMode": false,
    "glyphMode": true,
    "mode": 5,
    "pixel": false,
    "codecQuality": "high"
  }
}
```

### Preset Transition Semantics

Preset switching should use a default transition time in seconds. Individual presets may override it.

- Tween numeric client-side parameters with easing.
- Flip boolean/discrete parameters at the midpoint unless they require a renderer rebuild.
- For structural changes, use a two-surface transition:
  - tween non-structural parameters first.
  - keep current renderer visible during the soft tween.
  - initialize the new renderer with the final target state during the last transition phase.
  - crossfade old and new renderer surfaces, never fade to black.
  - preserve source aspect ratio and avoid zooming static media during preset switches.
  - preserve static video playback time and play state when the source file is unchanged.
  - clean up the old renderer.

### Preset Management UI

- Apply preset.
- Save current as preset.
- Update selected preset from current controls.
- Duplicate preset.
- Rename preset.
- Delete user presets.
- Set startup preset.
- Import/export preset JSON.
- Default transition time slider.
- Per-preset transition override.

### Built-In Presets

- **Point & Click Default**
  - Baseline copied from `ascii-point-and-click`.

- **Arcade Rain**
  - Higher saturation, mild jitter, darker blend. Good for neon footage.

- **CRT Ghost**
  - Lower contrast, slight background blend, slow jitter, softer colors.

- **Posterized Dream**
  - Strong contrast, lower color precision, minimal jitter.

- **Night Vision Terminal**
  - High contrast, reduced saturation, green-biased visual profile.

- **Ditherpunk Ultra**
  - High columns, tiny cells, strong saturation. Performance stress preset.

- **Soft Newspaper**
  - Low saturation, higher background blend, wider cells. Print-like.

- **Signal Loss**
  - Medium grid, high jitter, stronger background blend, glitchy but controlled.

- **Cinema ASCII**
  - Stable sampling and 24 FPS for video playback.

- **Pixel Mirage**
  - Solid/cell mode, high columns, boosted saturation.

- **Solar Guillotine**
  - Near-max resolution, hard contrast, high saturation, and fast jitter.

- **Acid Snowstorm**
  - Full saturation, bright exposure, aggressive jitter, and low codec quality for stress testing.

- **Blacklight Crush**
  - Dark, crushed, high-gamma neon look.

- **Velvet Void**
  - Very dark, coarse, low-saturation, heavy background blend.

- **Teletext Reactor**
  - Chunky solid-cell, high quantization, saturated teletext-style rendering.

- **Static Cathedral**
  - Maximum columns, high contrast, heavy blend, and fast jitter.

- **Icewire Grid**
  - Cold monochrome high-detail look with no jitter.

- **Infrared Riot**
  - Saturated, unstable, heat-map-like motion profile.

- **Chrome Wound**
  - Zero saturation, maximum contrast, bright metallic monochrome.

- **Paper Shredder**
  - Huge cells, high quantization, bleached print texture.

- **Whiteout Bloom**
  - High brightness, low contrast, washed-out glare.

- **Terminal Collapse**
  - Dark, coarse, high-jitter, low-color terminal failure mode.

Built-ins should be read-only. Users can duplicate them to customize.

## UI Direction

This is a tool surface, not a landing page.

- First viewport should be the usable lab.
- Large preview/canvas area.
- Top bar for source, backend, play/pause, status, and active preset.
- Right inspector for dense controls.
- Preset rail/list near the controls.
- Pop-out output button in the preview toolbar.
- Compact metrics: FPS, buffer, backend, frame size, wire/raw bandwidth.
- Visual direction inspired by the sibling `240-mp-jellyfin` project: sharp rectangular controls, VCR-style monospace typography, uppercase labels, video-blue surfaces, lavender secondary text, and pale cyan active selections.
- No point-and-click verb bar, inventory, or game UI.

## Pop-Out / External Display Mode

The output surface should support a separate display workflow without making the renderer lab UI fullscreen.

Initial implementation:

- Add a preview-toolbar command that opens a same-origin pop-out window.
- Mirror the active render surface into the pop-out:
  - static WebGPU/WebGL2 canvas when available.
  - static Canvas fallback canvas.
  - stream Canvas output.
- Include a fullscreen command inside the pop-out window because browsers require fullscreen to be triggered by a user gesture in that window.
- Use `window.getScreenDetails()` when available to place and size the pop-out on a non-primary screen.
- Fall back to a normal popup window when multi-screen placement is unavailable, denied, or unsupported.

Follow-up implementation:

- Optionally run a second renderer instance directly in the pop-out window for WebGPU/WebGL backends if canvas mirroring proves lossy or expensive.
- Persist preferred pop-out behavior.
- Add an explicit mirror health indicator.

## Tauri Desktop App Track

The desktop app should be a thin, secure wrapper around the renderer lab, not a rewrite. The static browser-only renderer must remain fully usable in a normal browser and should become the primary packaged experience inside Tauri.

### Packaging Strategy

- Use Tauri v2.
- Keep the frontend framework minimal. The current vanilla HTML/CSS/ESM app can be migrated to Vite without adopting React/Svelte/etc.
- Add a real frontend build step so Tauri packages built assets instead of depending on a dev static server.
- Treat standalone offline operation as a release blocker:
  - no CDN imports, remote decoders, remote fonts, analytics, telemetry, hosted media, or provider SDKs in the packaged runtime.
  - bundle renderer code, demo media, fonts, GPU assets, and any future native capture/stream sidecars with the app.
  - keep network behavior limited to the explicit GitHub Releases updater path and invoke it only through a deliberate app update flow.
  - run an offline bundle check against `dist/` before packaging.
- Keep packaged Tauri runtime policy local-only: production CSP must block arbitrary remote HTTP(S), Tauri capabilities must not grant remote origins command access, and the asset protocol scope should stay empty except for Rust-owned session-local selected media grants.
- Treat the Python/FastAPI stream server as optional:
  - **Default desktop app:** static browser-only renderer, custom local files, presets, pop-out/fullscreen output.
  - **Advanced/dev stream mode:** connect to an external server or launch a bundled sidecar.
  - **Long-term native stream path:** port the server-side media preparation path to Rust/FFmpeg or a standalone sidecar binary so end users do not need Python.
- Bundle built-in demo videos, images, fonts, and renderer assets as Tauri resources.
- Bundle reviewed FFmpeg/ffprobe binaries under `src-tauri/resources/ffmpeg/{os}-{arch}/bin/`; desktop stream commands should prefer env overrides for dev/CI, packaged resources for release, and `PATH` only as a development fallback. Use the staging/check scripts so each packaged binary carries version, SHA-256, license, source, and NOTICE metadata. Release validation must reject sidecars that are not actually standalone, including macOS binaries with absolute Homebrew/MacPorts-style dylib dependencies. The default release workflow now builds sidecars from the pinned official FFmpeg 8.1.2 source tarball with LGPL-compatible, network-disabled flags before packaging.

### File and Media Access

- Keep browser file-picker support for static browser mode.
- Add a Tauri adapter layer for desktop builds:
  - use Tauri dialog APIs to choose files and folders.
  - use filesystem/path APIs only through explicit capabilities.
  - convert selected filesystem paths into webview-loadable media URLs using Tauri's asset protocol.
- Register selected desktop media with a Rust-owned session registry before native stream commands can read it; stream/probe commands should accept only registry ids, not arbitrary paths.
- Keep media path handling behind a small source-provider interface so browser `File`/`blob:` and Tauri filesystem paths are interchangeable from the renderer's perspective.
- Add an audio-source adapter with the same boundary: browser `File`/`MediaStream` sources now, Tauri filesystem/system-loopback sources later.

### Windowing and External Displays

- Map the existing pop-out concept to native Tauri windows.
- Use one main control window and one optional output window.
- The output window should support borderless fullscreen, display selection, and independent size/position persistence.
- Keep browser pop-out behavior as the web fallback.

### Security Model

- Start with a narrow capability set:
  - dialog open-file/open-folder.
  - read access only to explicitly selected media paths.
  - app config/preset storage.
  - process restart capability only for installing signed updater packages.
- Split Tauri window capabilities so the output window cannot open dialogs, create more webviews, enumerate displays, or reposition other windows.
- Keep `withGlobalTauri` disabled unless a specific API requires it.
- Avoid broad home-directory read permissions.
- Set CSP deliberately once asset protocol/media needs are known. **Initial production/dev CSPs are in place and checked by `npm run check:tauri-policy`.**

### Cross-Platform Distribution

- macOS:
  - Apple Silicon release builds.
  - include camera, microphone, and screen-capture usage descriptions before testing media capture in packaged builds.
  - ad-hoc self-sign local/release bundles by default.
  - Developer ID signing/notarization is deferred until the app identity and distribution plan are ready for broader macOS testing.
  - when resumed, automate Developer ID certificate import, hardened-runtime signing, notarization submission, staple, and `spctl` validation once Apple credentials are available.
  - validate fullscreen output-window behavior on secondary displays.
- Windows:
  - WebView2/runtime assumptions documented; prefer a bundled/fixed runtime strategy if the app must install and run without network.
  - NSIS or MSI bundle target after smoke tests.
  - test WebGPU/WebGL2 behavior across Chromium WebView2 versions.
- Linux:
  - AppImage first for portability, then `.deb`/RPM if needed.
  - test WebKitGTK/WebGPU reality early; WebGL2 may be the practical primary backend on Linux Tauri until WebGPU support is proven.

### Tauri Preparation Phases

1. **Frontend Build Readiness**
   - Add `package.json`, Vite, and a deterministic static build output.
   - Preserve the current static-server workflow.
   - Move source files only as much as Vite requires.
   - Add a repeatable offline-runtime check for packaged frontend assets.
   - Status: initial Vite build scaffold is in place. Runtime media, fonts, and renderer asset folders are copied into `dist/` after build so packaged desktop output remains local-only. `npm run check:offline` now rebuilds and scans `dist/` for remote runtime URLs.

2. **Tauri Skeleton**
   - Add `src-tauri/`.
   - Configure app metadata, icon placeholders, main window dimensions, dev URL, and frontend dist path.
   - Verify `tauri dev` on macOS.
   - Keep npm Tauri scripts resilient when Rustup installed Rust but the active shell does not expose `cargo`.
   - Status: initial Tauri v2 project/config files are in place. Rustup has a stable toolchain installed in this environment; npm Tauri scripts now discover that toolchain when `cargo` is not on `PATH`. Cross-platform app icons have been generated from the desktop source icon and are referenced explicitly by the Tauri bundle config.

3. **Tauri Source Adapter**
   - Detect `window.__TAURI_INTERNALS__` or equivalent runtime marker through a small adapter.
   - Implement desktop file selection and media URL conversion.
   - Keep browser file selection unchanged.
   - Status: initial adapter is in place. Tauri builds use a Rust-owned native dialog command, register the selected media under a session-local id, and allow only selected files through the local asset protocol for custom media playback; browser builds keep the existing File System Access / file input path. Selected desktop paths are session-scoped and show **Needs access** after restart until persisted-scope behavior is deliberately added.

4. **Native Output Window**
   - Replace browser pop-out with a Tauri output window in desktop builds.
   - Preserve browser pop-out fallback.
   - Add display selection and fullscreen persistence.
   - Status: initial static-source implementation is in place. Tauri desktop builds open an `output.html` webview for static video/image sources, sync renderer params over Tauri events, and keep browser pop-out as the fallback for browser builds, stream mode, and camera mode. The main toolbar now exposes a persisted output-display selector backed by Tauri monitor enumeration, with auto-external placement as the default when multiple displays are available. The output window persists and restores its own fullscreen state. A deterministic secondary-display simulation test now covers auto-external placement, explicit display selection, stale preference fallback, and browser pop-out screen placement without requiring real multi-monitor hardware in CI. Follow-up work still needs real secondary-display validation and broader source support.

5. **Optional Stream Sidecar**
   - Decide whether to package Python, package a compiled server sidecar, or port the stream path.
   - If sidecar is used, add lifecycle management, port selection, logs, and crash recovery.
   - Status: in progress. Directional decision: prefer a Rust/FFmpeg port for the long-term packaged stream path. Keep Python/FastAPI as a dev/external-server path until the Rust media pipeline is implemented and tested. The first Rust media-engine slices now own FFmpeg/ffprobe process args, probe local video metadata, stream RGB24 frames without buffering the whole decode, prepare text, `[char,R,G,B]`, and `[B,G,R]` stream framebuffers, and compose decode -> prep -> adaptive encode -> Rust decode verification through the reusable `media_engine::pipeline` module. Tauri now has registered-source probe, pipeline-preview, start-session, read-frame/read-frame-batch, stop-session, and list-session commands that accept selected media ids/session ids, and `StreamRuntime` can consume native session frame batches through the same canvas decode/render path used by WebSocket stream mode. Raw RGB frame-prep parity against Python/OpenCV passes through `npm run test:frame-prep`; FFmpeg/OpenCV decode-resize parity uses bounded metrics through `npm run test:decode-resize`; `npm run check:media` also runs native session preview validation in ASCII-color and pixel modes. FFmpeg resource validation now rejects macOS sidecars that still depend on absolute non-system package-manager library paths. Release CI now source-builds and stages pinned FFmpeg 8.1.2 sidecars before packaging. See `docs/RUST_FFMPEG_PORT.md`.

6. **CI and Release Packaging**
   - Add GitHub Actions matrix builds for macOS, Windows, and Linux.
   - Add smoke tests for static mode and app launch.
   - Add signing/notarization/release steps once app identity is stable.
   - Status: in progress. The desktop workflow installs Node 24 and Rust, verifies the offline frontend bundle, checks the Tauri local-only security policy, runs the output-display simulation, verifies updater manifest generation, and runs a Tauri debug no-bundle build on macOS, Windows, and Linux. The release workflow now builds pinned LGPL FFmpeg/ffprobe sidecars from official source before the release gate, then requires the offline bundle, Tauri policy, output-display simulation, updater manifest test, current-platform reviewed FFmpeg sidecar, and Rust tests before release bundling. Release builds generate signed updater artifacts, self-sign macOS bundles ad-hoc, collect publishable assets, merge platform updater fragments into `latest.json`, and publish installers/updater metadata to GitHub Releases. Post-publish release smoke jobs download the public GitHub Release on real Windows and Linux runners, install the MSI/deb artifacts, verify bundled FFmpeg/ffprobe resources, run a bounded packaged-app launch, and force an updater-hop check/download through the Tauri updater plugin against the signed `latest.json` package. See `docs/TAURI_RELEASES.md`.

7. **macOS Developer ID Notarization**
   - Add GitHub secrets and workflow steps for Developer ID certificate import.
   - Switch macOS release builds from ad-hoc signing to Developer ID signing when notarization secrets are present.
   - Submit release artifacts to Apple notarization, wait for completion, staple the result, and verify with `spctl -a -vv`.
   - Keep ad-hoc signing as the local/default fallback when Apple credentials are absent.
   - Status: deferred. The initial conditional workflow path and helper scripts are already in place, but this work is intentionally paused until Developer ID credentials and a broader macOS distribution plan are ready. Current macOS builds remain codesign-valid with ad-hoc signing by default. If `APPLE_CERTIFICATE`, `APPLE_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD`, `KEYCHAIN_PASSWORD`, and App Store Connect or Apple ID notarization secrets are present later, the release workflow can import the Developer ID Application certificate into a temporary keychain, switch to `src-tauri/tauri.notarized.conf.json`, let Tauri sign/notarize/staple the macOS bundle, and run a Developer ID plus Gatekeeper validation step against the generated artifacts.

Reference docs used for the initial plan:

- Tauri v2 prerequisites.
- Tauri v2 project/configuration docs.
- Tauri v2 filesystem, dialog, capabilities, resources, sidecar, and GitHub distribution docs.

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Roadmap and Source Layout

- Add this roadmap.
- Copy point-and-click renderer/media source/assets into this repo.
- Convert page asset paths so the app works from a static server and the FastAPI server.
- Extend FastAPI static serving for copied renderer assets.

### Phase 2: Renderer Lab Shell

- Replace the blog page with a renderer lab app shell.
- Preserve the existing hidden audio element and player/canvas surfaces where useful.
- Add source mode controls.
- Add backend selector and status.
- Add inspector sliders/toggles for all known params.
- Gate inspector controls by active source/backend so every visible knob has an active runtime path.

- Support custom local video/image files as a single-select source-list item with Present, Missing, or Needs access status.
- Support local webcam/camera as a browser-only source through `MediaDevices.getUserMedia`.
- Support multiple simultaneous local camera devices when the browser/OS exposes them.
- Composite selected cameras locally with Canvas2D; no camera frames should leave the browser process.
- Keep camera frames local to the browser; do not upload or route them through the Python server.
- Expose camera device selection, facing mode, capture size, FPS, mirror, mixer layout, and framing only when Camera is the active static source.
- Render through copied WebGPU/WebGL2 renderer.
- Keep Canvas fallback path available.
- Allow source URL changes without page reload.

### Phase 4: Stream Renderer Integration

- Adapt decoded stream frames to the renderer interface.
- Add live WebSocket control messages.
- Add server-side handling for soft and reinit params.

### Phase 5: Presets and Transitions

- Implement built-in presets.
- Persist user presets in localStorage.
- Add import/export.
- Implement numeric tween transitions.

- Run stream legacy/adaptive e2e tests when media is available.
- Add browser smoke tests for:
  - static source load.
  - WebGL2 fallback.
  - Canvas fallback.
  - preset application.
  - live slider changes.
  - live stream reinit controls such as stream mode, pixel mode, grid size, and FPS cap.
  - conditional control visibility for stream, static GPU, and static Canvas contexts.
  - transition crossfade.
- Capture screenshots and inspect visual layout at desktop and mobile-ish widths.

### Phase 7: External Output Workflow

- Add pop-out output mirroring.
- Add in-pop-out fullscreen controls.
- Add best-effort secondary display placement through the Screen Details API.
- Validate static and streamed output mirroring.

### Phase 8: Desktop App Preparation

- Add a Vite build path while keeping static browser mode. **Done.**
- Add a Tauri v2 skeleton after the frontend build is deterministic. **Done.**
- Add a source-provider adapter for browser files vs. Tauri-selected filesystem paths. **Done.**
- Add a Rust-owned selected-media registry for Tauri native stream/probe commands. **Initial implementation done.**
- Implement a native Tauri output window after browser pop-out behavior stabilizes. **Initial implementation done.**
- Decide on the stream sidecar/native rewrite strategy before packaging stream mode for end users.
- Validate native stream session batches through the Rust/FFmpeg media pipeline before packaging stream mode. **Initial implementation done.**
- Keep `npm run check:offline`, `npm run check:desktop`, and `npm run smoke:static` passing before packaging changes.

### Phase 9: Audio-Reactive Controls

- Add the compact Audio Reactivity panel.
- Add local audio file, input, and display-audio sources through Web Audio.
- Add analysis meters and audio-reactive presets.
- Route generated features through a non-persistent `effectiveParams` layer.
- Verify static GPU/WebGL, Canvas fallback, stream Canvas, preset transitions, and pop-out output continue to consume current render params without regressions.

## Validation Strategy

Existing:

- `experiments/gen_vectors.py`
- `experiments/check_vectors.js`
- `experiments/test_e2e.js`
- `src-tauri/examples/check_codec_vectors.rs`
- `npm run test:vectors`
- `npm run test:frame-prep`
- `npm run test:decode-resize`

New:

- Static browser smoke test with generated or copied test media.
- Screenshot checks for the lab UI.
- Param update checks through DOM events.
- Fake-device camera smoke test for Camera selection, permission/status UI, device constraints, mirror toggle, presets, and fallback backends.
- Simulated multi-camera smoke test for the local camera mixer, device checklist, layout switching, and Canvas2D capture stream output.
- WebSocket control-message test once server handling is in place.

## Open Technical Risks

- Browser support for WebGPU varies; WebGL2 fallback must remain reliable.
- Static browser mode cannot load arbitrary local files without user selection or HTTP serving.
- Local camera capture requires a secure context such as `localhost` and explicit browser permission; device labels may remain blank until permission is granted.
- Simultaneous multi-camera capture depends on browser, OS, and hardware availability; some devices may reject concurrent capture or fixed constraints.
- Desktop packaging has initial macOS camera, microphone, and screen-capture usage descriptions; permission behavior still needs hands-on packaged-app validation across macOS, Windows, and Linux.
- Some WebSocket changes are not truly soft because OpenCV decoder resize changes require reinitialization.
- `ascii-point-and-click` assets include glyph/LUT files that are not part of the current quality target; keep them vendored for future experimentation but do not block the WebGPU/WebGL block-rendering path on them.
- TIFF support is disabled until a local decoder is vendored; the static/Tauri path must not load a CDN decoder.
- Homebrew FFmpeg is useful for development but is commonly GPL-enabled and dynamically linked against `/opt/homebrew`; standalone release packaging needs an explicit license decision and a self-contained sidecar build with bundled-relative dependencies.

## Definition of Done

- The repo documents the plan and architecture.
- The app launches into a renderer lab, not a blog page.
- Users can switch between stream and static modes.
- Users can render built-in media, custom local files, and one or more local camera sources without server upload.
- Users can tune exposed renderer, stream, and performance parameters live where technically possible.
- Users can create, save, import/export, and apply presets.
- Preset switches animate gracefully using the configured transition time.
- WebGPU is primary, WebGL2 fallback is available, Canvas fallback remains available.
- Existing codec tests still pass.
