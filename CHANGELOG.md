# Changelog

Version 0.9.1 adds traditional ASCII preset work and native Pop Out glyph
parity. Version 0.9.0 remains the first documentation baseline for the current
ASCII VJ Remix feature set.

## [0.9.1] - 2026-06-24

### Added

- Added traditional ASCII-style built-in presets:
  - Classic Camera ASCII.
  - ANSI Newsprint.
  - Terminal Mono.
  - Dense Typewriter.
- Added a Classic Camera character set inspired by the small luminance ramp used
  by `idevelop/ascii-camera`.
- Added native `wgpu` Pop Out glyph rendering for `glyphMode` presets:
  - native output now accepts `glyphMode` and `charset` from the canonical
    renderer params.
  - native GPU output uses a bundled fixed bitmap glyph atlas and charset ramp.
  - native software fallback/test rendering uses the same glyph ramp logic.
- Added Rust coverage for native glyph metadata parsing, render-uniform layout,
  and glyph-mask output.

### Changed

- Traditional ASCII presets select Canvas2D for the main preview so glyphs are
  visible immediately across demo image, demo video, custom media, and camera
  sources while native Pop Out renders matching glyph masks.
- WTF mode can now anchor randomized live-safe targets around the traditional
  ASCII presets as well as the extreme preset families.
- Character Set and Font Family select menus now use the compact select layout
  used by Audio Reactivity controls.
- Native output now preserves text/glyph style for static media and single
  camera sources instead of flattening glyph presets into solid cell blocks.
- Static smoke coverage now asserts that the Glyph/Cell group remains visible
  and compact while rendering the new traditional ASCII presets.
- Hardened media diagnostic redaction for embedded local paths and bounded
  diagnostic message size.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-06-23

### Added

- Renamed and positioned the app as ASCII VJ Remix.
- Renamed the repository/package identity to `ascii-vj-remix` and updated the
  GitHub remote/updater references.
- Added a Tauri v2 desktop app shell around the renderer lab.
- Added a Vite build pipeline so the same vanilla frontend can run in a browser
  or inside the packaged desktop app.
- Added local-first static source workflow:
  - Demo Image as the default startup source.
  - Demo Video as the visible built-in video fixture.
  - custom local image/video file selection.
  - MKV file selection support where the active decoder path can handle it.
  - camera source support.
  - multi-camera selection and local Canvas2D camera mixing.
- Added high-quality renderer backends:
  - WebGPU as the primary browser GPU path.
  - WebGL2 fallback.
  - Canvas2D and pixel Canvas fallbacks.
- Added dense live renderer controls for grid, rows, cell dimensions, color,
  brightness, contrast, gamma, background blend, quantization, jitter, sample
  position, smoothing, FPS, glyph/cell mode, and performance status.
- Added built-in visual presets, including a wider set of extreme high-jitter,
  high-contrast, high-saturation, low-column, low-gamma, and high-gamma looks.
- Added user preset save, copy, update, delete, import, and export workflows.
- Added smooth preset transitions with numeric tweening and renderer-surface
  crossfades.
- Added WTF mode for continuous randomized live-safe transitions.
- Added a Stats Overlay that shows current preset, source, backend, grid, FPS,
  transition time, and audio-reactivity state.
- Added audio-reactive rendering:
  - Mic/Input default source.
  - local audio file source.
  - browser Display Audio where the browser provides audio tracks.
  - native Tauri audio capture paths for desktop builds.
  - RMS, bass, mid, treble, transient, and beat-driven modulation.
  - safe clamps to avoid pure white or pure black outputs at high sensitivity.
- Added native Tauri Pop Out output:
  - separate output window for another screen.
  - native `wgpu` presenter for file-backed video/image sources.
  - Metal path on macOS.
  - D3D12/Vulkan/GLES target support through `wgpu`.
  - native macOS single-camera capture path through AVFoundation for low camera
    latency in Pop Out.
  - output display selection and secondary-display simulation tests.
- Added local-only desktop media selection through a Tauri dialog and
  session-scoped media registry.
- Added production Content Security Policy and split Tauri capabilities.
- Added GitHub Releases updater infrastructure.
- Added ad-hoc macOS app signing as the default local/release fallback.
- Added optional Developer ID notarization workflow scaffolding for future use.
- Added FFmpeg sidecar build/staging policy for standalone media-engine work.
- Added Rust media-engine slices for FFmpeg probing/decoding, frame prep, and
  adaptive stream encoding validation.
- Added static browser smoke tests, output-display tests, updater manifest
  tests, FFmpeg resource policy checks, media parity checks, and Rust tests.
- Added project practice docs for security, performance, testing,
  accessibility, and internationalization.

### Changed

- The normal Source UI now exposes static local sources instead of a visible
  Static/Streaming selector.
- The Source panel now shows Demo Image, Demo Video, Camera, and custom file
  entries only.
- Camera controls now appear directly below Source when Camera is active.
- Stream-only UI such as buffer count and top-right stream connection status is
  hidden from normal static/camera/file use.
- Presets and WTF mode no longer toggle Stats Overlay unless the user changes
  that setting directly.
- Preset transitions preserve active media source and video playback time when
  the source is unchanged.
- The app is now documented as a standalone local-first creative tool rather
  than only as an ASCILINE streaming server fork.
- The UI theme now uses black and graphite surfaces with white active accents,
  neon blue ready/on states, and neon pink warning/WTF/update states instead of
  the previous blue-dominant palette while preserving the compact control
  density and high-contrast status accents.

### Development and Release

- Node.js 24 is the baseline JavaScript runtime.
- Release CI builds on macOS, Windows, and Linux.
- Release CI builds reviewed FFmpeg/ffprobe sidecars from pinned official
  FFmpeg source with network protocols disabled.
- The updater private key is intentionally external and must be supplied through
  `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY`.
- The updater key is password-protected; release automation now also requires
  `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY_PASSWORD`.
- Local macOS builds can use a stable self-signed identity for better TCC
  permission reuse during development.

### Known Limitations

- Stream mode exists as legacy/dev infrastructure but is hidden from the normal
  Source UI until the standalone workflow is fully productized.
- MIDI hardware control is planned but not shipped in 0.9.0.
- Apple Developer ID signing and notarization are deferred.
- Linux WebGPU behavior depends heavily on WebKitGTK, Mesa/vendor drivers, and
  distro packaging; WebGL2 may be the practical Linux fallback.
- MKV support depends on the active platform decoder path.
- System/display audio capture behavior varies by operating system and browser.
